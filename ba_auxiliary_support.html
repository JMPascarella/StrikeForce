                    <p>Commander Dante is one of the most legendary Space Marine Commanders in the Imperium. He has led the Blood Angels
                    Chapter for over 1,000 years and it is widely believed that he is the oldest living Space Marine. No-one within the
                    Imperium has fought in as many war zones as Dante and few can match him for the number of foes he has killed. Amongst
                    Space Marines, Dante is regarded as a paragon of the Space Marine's cause to defend humanity. Amongst mortal men he is
                    nothing less than a saviour, a golden god who descends from the heavens on wings of fire to smite his foes in deadly
                    close combat. </p>

                    <p>The Sanguinor is a golden angel of vengeance who descends from the heavens only in times of the Blood Angels' greatest
                    need. To most he is a myth, but those few who have seen him cut a bloody path through the Blood Angels' enemies know
                    different.
                    <br>
                    Rising up from trails of elaborate scrolls, the Sanguinor is an astonishingly detailed miniature. With two angel wings
                    stretched out wide, which is mirrored in the pose of his arms, the Sanguinor carries a grail in one hand and a sword
                    featuring a hilt in the style of the Blood Angels icon in the other. Winged details can be found across its muscular
                    torso, laurel wreath motifs on the knees of the armour, as well as gemstones, metal studs and an iron halo set between
                    his wings. His shoulder pads contain raised, sculpted details of the Blood Angels iconography.

                    Librarian. He is a figure of awe and reverence to most of his Battle-Brothers, who perceive him as a saviour in these
                    times of woe.
                    <br>
                    The highly detailed Mephiston model contains a number of fascinating features that mark him out in any Warhammer 40,000
                    collection. He wears a flowing robe and cloak, lavish artificer armour, and a psychic hood topped with horned skulls.
                    His belt is detailed with gems in the shape of blood drops, and also features two syringes. There is an immense skull on
                    one shoulder pad and Blood Angels iconography on the other. Skulls also feature along his cloak as well as in the centre
                    of his chest. He also carries a plasma pistol and an immense force sword.

                    Though Lemartes himself is afflicted by the accursed Black Rage, his formidable willpower has allowed him to remain in
                    control of his actions, leaving him free to lead the Death Company in glorious charges that eclipse all the deeds of
                    legend.

                    Lemartes stands atop a rocky base in a dynamic pose with his bolt pistol in one hand and the Crozius Arcanum in another.
                    His armour is full of details including purity seals, scrolls, Blood Angels iconography, chalice imagery, as well as an
                    immense skull on one shoulder pad. His jump pack, too, is plastered with similar features. A halo encapsulates his skull
                    head, and he has boned feet protruding from beneath his riveted armour.</p>
