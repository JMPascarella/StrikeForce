                    <p>Martellos is an Epistolary in the Blood Angels Chapter who is coldly calm in battle, as his thoughts and actions have
                        been tempered by over a century of training within the Chapter's Librarium. He is a force to be reckoned with upon
                        the
                        battlefield, as he is able to twist and turn reality to his desires, and he shows a special gift for the Sanguinary
                        discipline. Martellos also shares a bond with Captain Arenos Karlaen, as the two have fought side by side many times
                        before. As a result he is often seconded to the First Company, where Karlaen values the Epistolary's wise council
                        and
                        the havoc he can wreck in battle.</p>

                    <p>Aerati Lamentarios has served in the Blood Angels Sanguinary Priesthood for decades, his duty as a warrior inexorably
                        intertwined with the preservation and purity of the Chapter's gene-seed and the tempering of the madness of the Red
                        Thirst. It was his fascination with the Flaw and its influence over the blood Angels that first drew Lamentarios to
                        join the Sanguinary Priesthood, and to pledge himself to the well-being of his afflicted battle-brothers.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Lamentarios has saved the lives of many of his brothers, guiding them back from the brink of death with his
                        narthecium. Equally, by offering up the blessed contents of his blood chalice he has offered his brothers a taste of
                        the essence of their Primarch and the gift of a measure of his power that comes with it. Yet the role of Sanguinary
                        Priest is not one for those that harbour even the barest sliver of self-doubt. Lamentarios has had to watch many
                        brothers succumb to their wounds, knowing that despite his skills he can do nothing but grant them the Emperor's
                        final mercy.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Lamentarios has gone with his brothers into unimaginable danger many times. However, he is more than just a warrior
                        of the Emperor, and when he looks into the faces of his battle-brothers, his thoughts often stray to the precious
                        gene-seeds that hide within their chests. One way or another, these pieces of Sanguinius must find their way back to
                        Baal.

                    <p>Brother Chaplain Grimani has battled his way through some of the most horrific battles in the Blood Angels' history.
                        Never once
                        has his composure failed him. Never once has he succumbed to the Flaw, and this alone is enough to have seen him
                        elevated to the rank of Death Company Chaplain. No matter how dire the circumstances or dread the foe, Grimani's icy
                        composure never cracks. Moreover, his deep spirituality and natural leadership qualities do much to steady the
                        warriors
                        around him. He is a light in the darkness, a beacon of hope and fortitude amongst the smoke-wreathed hell of the
                        battlefield, and even the most lost of his brothers follow his lead without question.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Grimani is entrusted to lead his Lost Brethren into battle and the only way to lead the Death Company is from the
                        front. Equipped with a jump pack, Grimani keeps pace with his battle-brothers, his crozius arcanum - the symbol of
                        his office and a potent power weapon - held high above his head. Grimani's armour is adorned with purity seals and a
                        tabard covered in litanies hangs down his front. Everything about Grimani speaks of his duty to his Chapter, and
                        even though his brothers are doomed to die, it falls to Grimani to help them find absolution and an end in the
                        carnage of battle.</p>
